# TODO

Topics to add as visualizers:

- Consistent replication log (Kafka-style partitions/ISR)
- Failure detectors (phi accrual, SWIM)
- Distributed transactions: 3PC, saga pattern
- Load balancing and backpressure in microservices
- Network partitions and split-brain mitigation (ZooKeeper/etcd)
- Consensus variants: Raft joint consensus, EPaxos, Multi-Paxos
